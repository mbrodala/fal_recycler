Installation
============

* Download the extension from github as zip or the blogpost at http://www.typo3worx.eu/
* Go to the Extension Manager and upload the extension "fal_recycler".

It is not available in the TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER) yet. As TYPO3 6.2 is EOL in spring 2017, I will not add it
to the TER

Configuration
=============

Go to the filelist modul and create a folder named "_recycler_". The first one will be most likely under the root
 folder

Usage
=====

For the usage, see my blogpost on http://www.typo3worx.eu/

Credits go to Dominique Kreemers (https://github.com/Domi202), who originally had the idea and  developed the extension.
I did some cosmetic work ...
